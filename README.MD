## Project Description
The goal of this Excel data project is to analyze the sales data of a bike store and understand how different variables like age, marital status, distance, and income impact the number of bikes sold. The project will utilize a large dataset consisting of various customer demographics and purchasing behaviors, including age, gender, income, distance from the store, and marital status.

The project will begin by cleaning and organizing the data in Excel, removing any irrelevant or incomplete information and ensuring consistency across all fields. Next, various statistical tools will be used to perform a thorough analysis of the data, including mean, median, and mode calculations, as well as histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations.

The project will focus on identifying trends and patterns in the data, looking for correlations between different variables and the number of bikes sold. For example, the project may explore whether younger customers tend to purchase more bikes than older customers, or whether customers who live closer to the store are more likely to make a purchase.

The project will also look at how these variables impact sales over time, analyzing sales data from different periods to determine whether there are any seasonal trends or changes in purchasing behavior.
